FinalProject
============
I work at Harvard's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, the hub of the Kennedy School's research, teaching, and training in international security affairs, environmental and resource issues, and science and technology policy. Several years ago, Belfer Center Director Graham Allison commissioned for a custom website to be built as a promotional tool for his then new book, 'NUCLEAR TERRORISM: The Ultimate Preventable Catastrophe'. 

As a supplement to the website (http://nuclearterror.org), a custom mapping application called a blast map was developed so visitors could visualize the negative effects of a 10-kiloton nuclear explosion in a specific location (http://nuclearterror.org/blastmap/index.html). It was recently brought to my attention that the Belfer Center has been paying an arm and leg for this site each month due to astronomical hosting fees. With that said, I would like to recreate and perhaps improve/build upon the blast map application seen on nuclearterror.org. 

By rebuilding the site and blast map app on one of our own servers, not only will I be saving my workplace money, but  I will also be able to make future modifications to the blast map app when needed by being the author of the source code.
